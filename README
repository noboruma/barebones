The aim of the repository is to provide a convenient way to start a Makefile-related project (such as C/C++/Ocaml, whatever).
This repository aims at providing a small set of generic configuration files in order to generate Makefiles using autotools.
Just copy your source in the right folder, rename/copy some code snippets and you'll be quickly done !

Features easy to set using this repository:
- Generate Makefile (make)
- Generate tests (make check)
- Set release/debug mode (configure --enable-debug)
- Set external library checking (configure --with-mylib=path, or nothing if globally available)
- Generate config.h and run.sh launcher script

Below is an example of set, compile, run workflow:

=== HOW TO INSTALL ===

run the following:
./bootstrap.sh
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --with-stdlib=$PWD/../extern/stdlib
make -j

=== HOW TO RUN ===

from the build directory run:
./src/run.sh
